# Endless Runner Prototype

This is an endless runner game prototype developed using **Unreal Engine 5.4**.

## Purpose of the Prototype

The primary purpose of this prototype was to learn the core features of Unreal Engine 5 through various tutorials and to successfully implement fundamental game mechanics.

The key features implemented in this project are:

* **Character Controller:** Implementation of basic player actions, including movement, jumping, and sliding.

* **Procedural Level Generation:** A system that dynamically and infinitely generates map tiles and obstacles as the game progresses.

* **Blueprint Communication:** Data communication and event calls between various Blueprints, such as the Character, Game Mode, and UI Widgets.

* **Complete Game Flow:** A full game cycle, from the main menu to an in-game state, and a game-over screen that displays the final score and collected coins.

* **Data Persistence:** A save system that stores the player's high score and collected coins, ensuring the data persists between game sessions.

## Controls

The player can be controlled using either the keyboard arrows or the WASD keys.

* **Move Left / Turn Left at Corners:** `A` or `Left Arrow`

* **Move Right / Turn Right at Corners:** `D` or `Right Arrow`

* **Jump:** `W` or `Up Arrow`

* **Slide:** `S` or `Down Arrow`
