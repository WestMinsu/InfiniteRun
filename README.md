# Endless Runner Prototype

This is an endless runner game prototype developed using **Unreal Engine 5.4**.

## Purpose of the Prototype
The main purpose of this prototype is to learn the core features of Unreal Engine 5 by following various tutorials and to successfully implement its fundamental game mechanics.

The implemented features are as follows:

* **Character Controller:** Learned to implement basic player actions such as moving, jumping, and sliding. 

* **Procedural Level Generation:** Understood and applied the principle of dynamically and infinitely generating map tiles and obstacles as the game progresses.

* **Blueprint Communication:** Practiced methods for data communication and event calls between various Blueprints, such as the Character, Game Mode, and UI Widgets.

* **Complete Game Flow:** Implemented a full game cycle, from starting the game at the main menu to transitioning to a game over screen that displays the final score and collected coins upon collision.

* **Data Persistence:** Implemented a feature to save the player's high score and collected coins, ensuring the data persists even after closing the game.

## Controls

The player can be controlled using either the keyboard arrows or the WASD keys.

* **Move Left / Turn Left at Corners:** `A` or `Left Arrow`

* **Move Right / Turn Right at Corners::** `D` or `Right Arrow`

* **Jump:** `W` or `Up Arrow`

* **Slide:** `S` or `Down Arrow`
